					<p>The company works to bridge the gap between merchants and those in need of services by using geolocating and simple search features.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Users can easily identify merchants close to them that provide the services they want, or find people that are able to provide their services in an online format that can be accessed from anywhere.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Additionally, through online payment handling, the company ensures that the payment process is simple for customers and that merchants are paid for their work so that they can continue to bring their services to others.</p>

						<li>You may use the filter dropdowns and range slider to set the search parameters you want. The map will adjust in real time and show markers for the merchants that match your search.</li>
						<li>To make a booking, simply click on the merchant’s calendar icon and choose an available date and time.</li>
